# British Airways Virtual Internship â€“ Customer Booking Prediction

This project is part of the **British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience** on Forage. The objective was to analyze customer booking behavior and build a predictive model that can determine whether a user will complete their booking.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

- Predict whether a customer will complete a flight booking based on behavioral, demographic, and transactional data.
- Utilize machine learning to extract actionable insights and enhance the optimization of marketing and retention strategies.

---

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains >50,000 anonymized booking records with features such as:

- **Customer behavior**: wants_extra_baggage, wants_meals, preferred_seat
- **Booking details**: trip_type, sales_channel, booking_origin
- **Flight context**: route, flight_duration, flight_hour, day of week
- **Target**: `booking_complete` (1 = completed, 0 = not completed)

---

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Label Encoding for categorical features
   - Null check and structure validation

2. **Model Training**
   - Random Forest Classifier (scikit-learn)
   - 80/20 train/test split with stratification

3. **Evaluation**
   - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1)
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Feature Importance Analysis

---

## Results

- **Accuracy**: 85%
- **Precision (Booking = 1)**: 56%
- **Recall (Booking = 1)**: 52%
- **Top Features**:
  - Purchase Lead Time
  - Length of Stay
  - Flight Duration
  - Ancillary preferences (e.g. baggage, meals)
  - Sales Channel

---

## Business Insights

- **Customers booking in advance** are more likely to complete the booking â€“ suggest targeted offers for short-lead users.
- **Ancillary services** (such as baggage and meals) signal high booking intent, making them ideal for upselling.
- **Longer trips** and **holiday profiles** show higher conversion than short business trips.
- **Digital channel (Internet)** is dominant, optimizing the online funnel is critical.
